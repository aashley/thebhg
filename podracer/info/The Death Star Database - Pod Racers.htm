      <P>Aldar's pod is blue and yellow and can be recognized by it's box-shaped 
      engines and elongated cockpit. Aldar Beedo is a Glymphid hitman who often 
      works for fellow racers to put them out of action. When Wan Sandage hired 
      Beedo to assassinate Sebulba, Beedo entered the Boonta Eve Classic. He was 
      unable to kill Sebulba in the race. Beedo's vehicle relies on sheer power 
      and it's aerodynamic design to win racers. It is especially good on 
      straighaways, but it has trouble pulling corners.

      <P>Created from scrap supplies found in Watto's Junkyard, Anakin Skywalker 
      built a podracer that proved to be the fastest pod in the Boonta Eve 
      Classic. The pod is uses a Ulzer 620C engine. The racer's air scoops in 
      front of each engine increase the vehicle's maneuverability, while 
      multiple air brakes allow Anakin to make sudden stops and corner 
      effectively. A fuel atomiser and distribution system further increase the 
      racer's performance.

      <P>Ark uses a bizarre, low performance racer with a compact Plug-8G engine 
      in a small cockpit. The racer is notable for its squat twin-turbine 
      engines which provide moderate thrust and are very maneuverable. Roose has 
      raced in numerous events and is aware of Anakin's skill. Roose planned on 
      sabatoging Anakin's racer before the event but accidentaly sabatoged Ben's 
      pod instead.

      <P>Ben rides in a unique 'quadra-pod' with four smaller engines connected 
      to one cockpit. Being so large, Ben was not able to get a racer and was 
      forced to rent one before the Boonta Eve Classic after recieving a 
      challenge from Boles Roor. Being a frightened Toong, Ben has never 
      finished an event as dangerous as the Boonta Eve Race. Before the race, 
      Ark Roose tampered with the engines of his pod which stalled the his 
      takeoff. Later, his power-couplink failed, which sent the four engines in 
      all directions.

      exceedingly long cockpit. Boles himself is known as a notorious drunkard 
      and he earns a fortune as a famous glimmik singer. He frequently gambes on 
      podraces, however, much of his wealth is lost as he bets on the wrong 
      ships. Boles is also not known to be a talented pilot himself. His 
      podracer is unmodified and is known for it's poor welding and sub-standard 
      components.

      massive and powerful engines. While his Wasp is well built, Clegg is a

      during events. With the help of his durable podracer, Dud Bolt whill do 
      anything to collide into other racers, as he recieves a bonus for each one 
      he disables. Bolt flies in a durable pod which can be identified by it's 
      prolonged engines.

      Podraces, Ebe was able to purchase a Corellian Freighter with his 
      winnings. He used the ship to travel to Tatooine were he hopped to win the 
      Boona Eve Classic. Ebe is a confident and talented racer, and does not 
      feel threatened by Sebulba.

      <P>Elan Mak, whose real name is Kan Nale, was the son of a Fluggrian crime 
      lord who was murdered by Aldar Beedo. Planning for revenge, Nale entered 
      in the Boonta Eve Classic under the name of Elan Mak; the opposite of his 
      real name. Nale's podracer has a round cockpit with buldous engines. The 
      pod proves to be very effective and durable. Neural bundles in Nale's 
      forhead allow him to process sensory input at very high speeds, which 
      greatly increases his reaction time.

      the conventional steelton cables. With the cockpit in front of the

      <P>Sebulba pilots a heavily modified and highy illegal podracer. Extremely 
      durable, Sebulba is allowed to collide with other racers during an event 
      and knock them off of cliffs, into walls and other haszards. In extreme 
      circumstances, Sebulba resorts to an illegal flame thrower mounted in the 
      racer's engine. While the podracer was nearly distroyed during the Boonta 
      Eve Classic, Sebulba managed to survive and will undoubtedly return to his 
      sport.

      <P>Teemto's podracer has a circular cockpit which makes it unique. The 
      cockpit was built around a gyroscopic stabilizer and was supported by a 
      rudder. Becamse the racer lacked a canopy, Teemto relied on numerous 
      sensor readouts and a monitor to watch to track. During the Boonta Eve 
      Classic, Teemto was the racer with the longest engines. During the race, 
      however, Teemto's racer was shot by Tusken Raiders which was destroyed in 
      the explosion. It is not confirmed whether or not the Mandellian survived 
      the crash, but his circular cockpit most likely saved him from death.

      <P>Wan Sandage is a playboy and a podracing expert. His Elsinore-Cordova 
      has a distinctive large fin and an insectoid appearance. At age six and 
      already a rapidy aging Devlikk, Sandage entered the Boonta Eve Classic in 
      hope of finally achieving victory in a race. Realizing Sebulba would 
      probably win the race, Sandage hired hitman/racer Aldar Beedo, who failed 
      to kill the dug before the race.
